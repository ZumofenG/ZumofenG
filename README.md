ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZumofenG

I am a **PhD candidate** at the Institute of Political Science, University of Bern, and research assistant of the 'AnnÃ©e Politique Suisse' (APS). 
 
My research interests include political communication, political psychology, voting behavior, online media, and referendum campaigns.
For example, I am currently working on projects related to political information selection online, and notably on Google. 
 
Additionaly, I am taking part in a further education program **CAS in Applied Data Science** to improve my Data Science skills, and more specifically to learn Machine learning.
